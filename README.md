Bird Strikes in Aviation: Analyzing Aircraft Collisions with Birds to Enhance Aviation Safety


**Ethical Considerations**
This project prioritized ethical considerations by utilizing anonymized FAA data in compliance with public access policies, ensuring confidentiality and focusing on enhancing aviation safety. Efforts were made to avoid biases by accounting for variables such as flight frequency and geography, preventing misleading correlations. Findings were framed to emphasize safety and risk mitigation rather than assigning blame to specific aircraft, airlines, or regions. The dataset provides valuable insights into bird strike patterns, analyzing factors like aircraft type, location, flight phase, and species involved. These insights help identify risk factors and trends, supporting strategies to reduce the frequency and impact of bird strikes and ultimately improving aviation safety.
